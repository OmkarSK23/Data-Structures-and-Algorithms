A linked list is a type of linear data structure individual items are not necessarily at contiguous locations. 
The individual items are called nodes and connected with each other using links.

A node contains two things first is data and second is a link that connects it with another node.
The first node is called the head node and we can traverse the whole list using this head and next links.


Creating a Node Class
We have created a Node class in which we have defined a __init__ function to initialize the node with the data passed as an argument,
and a reference with None because if we have only one node then there is nothing in its reference.

Implementation of Simple 4 Nodes Linked List
Example: Below is a simple example to create a singly linked list with three nodes containing integer data.
