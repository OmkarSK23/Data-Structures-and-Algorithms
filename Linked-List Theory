A linked list is a type of linear data structure individual items are not necessarily at contiguous locations. 
The individual items are called nodes and connected with each other using links.

A node contains two things first is data and second is a link that connects it with another node.
The first node is called the head node and we can traverse the whole list using this head and next links.
